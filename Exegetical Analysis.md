Exegetical Analysis

Preliminary summary- Pray, read the text, and summarize. This is your personal
observations, write everything that pops out of the text from words, situations, and
things that seem strange.

Historical-cultural analysis- consider the historical and cultural environment in which an
author wrote to understand his allusions, references, and purpose.

Contextual analysis- Consider the relationship of the given passage to the entire
passage surrounding it, since a better understanding of an author’s intended meaning
results from an acquaintance with the larger context.

Lexical-syntactical analysis- Develop the understanding of the definition of words
(lexicology) and their relationship to one another (syntax) to understand more
accurately the meaning the author intended to convey

Theological analysis- Consider the level of theological understanding at the time a
revelation was given to ascertain the meaning of the text for its original recipients. It
also considers related Scriptures, weather given before or after the passage being study.

Literary (genre) analysis- Identify the literary form or method used in the passage
(genre). Such as historical narrative, epistle (letter), poetry, and so on; devices include
idioms, symbolism, hyperbole, etc. Each genre and literary device present diverse
attributes and interpretive demands.

Comparison analysis- Compare translations, other commentators (commentary).

Application- The important step of translating the meaning a Biblical text had for its
original hearers into the significance it has for believers in different time and culture.
